Hi, I'm Ben Curtis, and in this video, I present RegimeIQ, an AI-powered financial signal intelligence platform I developed using React, ReCharge, and the Cloud API. RegimeIQ addresses the challenge of evaluating forecasting models by distinguishing between reliable signals and overfitting to historical noise across different market regimes. I demonstrate how users can input a ticker and date range to receive a quantitative analysis report, including metrics like total return and Sharpe ratio, along with a regime breakdown. I encourage you to explore how this platform can enhance your investment strategies by providing insights that go beyond standard charting tools. Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback!
